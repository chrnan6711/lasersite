## Welcome!

I'll be hosting all my expressions and whatnot here so I can organize them and update them whenever necessary. I also won't need to create or keep track of pastebin links all the time anymore!

I might also write some breakdowns of the expressions I create so others can use them for inspiration, reference, and learning purposes.

I don't care who you are or who you may like or hate; you may use my lasers. I would prefer that I am credited at least some bit, but other than that, pretend that this information just appeared out of thin air. Thank you.
